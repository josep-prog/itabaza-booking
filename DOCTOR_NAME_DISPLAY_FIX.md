# Doctor Dashboard Name Display Fix

## Problem
The doctor dashboard was showing a hardcoded "Dr. John Doe" instead of displaying the actual logged-in doctor's name. This was happening because:

1. The frontend dashboard JavaScript was looking for `doctorInfo.doctor_name` 
2. The backend login API was only returning the field as `name` (not `doctor_name`)
3. The `qualifications` field was also missing from the login response

## Solution
### Backend Changes (`/Backend/routers/dashboard.router.js`)

Updated the doctor login endpoint to return both `doctor_name` and `qualifications` fields:

```javascript
// Before (line 81-84):
doctor: {
    id: doctor.id,
    name: doctor.doctor_name,
    email: doctor.email,
    department_id: doctor.department_id
}

// After (line 81-86):
doctor: {
    id: doctor.id,
    doctor_name: doctor.doctor_name,
    name: doctor.doctor_name, // For backward compatibility
    email: doctor.email,
    department_id: doctor.department_id,
    qualifications: doctor.qualifications
}
```

## Frontend Code (Already Working)
The frontend dashboard JavaScript (`/Frontend/Scripts/doctor-dashboard.js`) was already correctly implemented:

```javascript
// Line 92-93: Correctly looking for doctor_name and qualifications
document.getElementById('doctorName').textContent = doctorInfo.doctor_name || 'Dr. John Doe';
document.getElementById('doctorSpecialty').textContent = doctorInfo.qualifications || 'General Practitioner';
```

## Testing
### Automated Test Results 

Ran `test-doctor-name-fix.js` which confirmed:
-  Doctor name available: YES
-  Qualifications available: YES  
-  Will display real name: YES (not "Dr. John Doe")

### Test Data Used
- **Doctor Name**: "Dr. John Smith"
- **Email**: john.smith@iTABAZA.com  
- **Qualifications**: "MD Cardiology, FACC"

### Manual Testing Available

Access the test page at: **http://127.0.0.1:3000/test-doctor-dashboard-fix.html**

This test page allows you to:
1. Simulate a doctor login (stores data in localStorage)
2. Test the dashboard name display logic
3. Open the real dashboard to see the fix in action
4. Clear test data when done

## Files Modified
1. `/Backend/routers/dashboard.router.js` - Added `doctor_name` and `qualifications` to login response

## Files Created
1. `/test-doctor-name-fix.js` - Automated test script
2. `/Frontend/test-doctor-dashboard-fix.html` - Manual test page
3. `/DOCTOR_NAME_DISPLAY_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Result
The dashboard will now display:
- **Real doctor name** instead of "Dr. John Doe"
- **Real doctor qualifications** instead of "General Practitioner"

The fix is backward compatible and maintains the existing frontend code without changes.
